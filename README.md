# FURNITURES REACT PROJECT 

This project is based on themewagon example project : https://themewagon.github.io/furni/index.html <br>
I added some extra features to it, like form to add new posts on the blog.

## There are two main folders in this project : 
- backend : This is the backend of the project, which is coded in Node.js + Express
- frontend : This is the frontend of the project, which is coded in React, TypeScript, Tailwind and Vite

**You need to start both the frontend and backend servers to run the project.**

## Installation

### Frontend

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

### Backend

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
This will start the backend server on port 5000.
